# Applied-ML-algorithms-using-DUMD-dataset âš¡

## Abstract 
Using different machine leaining algorithms in DUMP dataset.
using Chi-squared , SVM classifier
Build OvO-SVM, test on DUMD testing dataset with obtained features from Problem
Build OvR-SVM, test on DUMD testing dataset with obtained features from Problem
last thing visualization results with each algorithm

## Dataset 
using https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/User+Knowledge+Modeling

Attribute Information about the data:

* STG (The degree of study time for goal object materails), (input value)
* SCG (The degree of repetition number of user for goal object materails) (input value)
* STR (The degree of study time of user for related objects with goal object) (input value)
* LPR (The exam performance of user for related objects with goal object) (input value)
* PEG (The exam performance of user for goal objects) (input value)
* UNS (The knowledge level of user) (target value)

## Technologies 
* Chi-squared 
* SVM classifier
* OvR-SVM
